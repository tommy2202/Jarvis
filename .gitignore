# Jarvis repository hygiene: source vs runtime separation
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
# - This repo is intended to track source-of-truth code and configuration only.
# - Runtime outputs (logs, state, caches) and secure material must never be tracked.
# - This block is safe to keep and safe to apply repeatedly.
